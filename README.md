# frc-team-summary
Command line program that summarizes a FRC team's season

Want to try it out? Follow these steps.
1. Install poetry from https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
2. Clone this project
3. In the project folder, execute the following commands:
```
poetry shell
poetry install
```
4. Execute the script
```
python main.py
```
Note that you will have to paste in your TBA API key in every time you run the script. If you want to avoid having to do this repeatedly, you can paste your key into the auth_key variable on line 4 in main.py, and it will stop asking you.

When you're done, you can exit the poetry shell with the following command:
```
exit
```
